# Physics-Simulations

Collection of numerical simulations of different physical phenomena

## Examples


#### Quantum tunneling

Time-evolution of the 1D Schrodinger equation, where a particle (gaussian wave packet) hits a potential barrier with an energy slightly higher than the particle energy.

#### Double slit interference

Time-evolution of 2D Schrodinger equation, where a 2D gaussian wave packet travels through a double slit. Simulated using alternating direction implicit method over a 1024x1024 grid. For all of the plots, the color represents the phase angle between the real and imaginary parts of the equation.

#### ResNet function approximator applied to damped pendulum

Demonstrates the use of a one-step residual neural network for data-driven equation approximation. The method aims to be useful for recovering unknown governing equations based only on coarsely distributed observational data of trajectories. It is demonstrated on a dynamical system of a damped pendulum, with a dataset of trajectories generated by an accurate ODE solver. Animation shows the model's predictions on a sample data point at each epoch of training.
